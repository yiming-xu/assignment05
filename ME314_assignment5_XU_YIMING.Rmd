You will need to load the core library for the course textbook:

library(caret)

## Exercise 5.1

In this problem, you will develop a model to predict whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage based on the `Auto` dataset from the `ISLR` package.

(a) Create a binary variable, `mpg01`, that contains a 1 if `mpg` contains a value above its median, and a 0 if `mpg` contains a value below its median. You can compute the median using the `median()` function. Note you may find it helpful to use the `data.frame()` function to create a single data set containing both `mpg01` and the other `Auto` variables.

```{r}
data("Auto")
head(Auto)
mpg_threshold = median(Auto$mpg)
AutoN = data.frame(Auto[, names(Auto) != "mpg"])
AutoN$mpg01 = ifelse(Auto$mpg > mpg_threshold, 1, 0)
AutoN$mpg01 = factor(AutoN$mpg01)
head(AutoN)
```

(b) Explore the data graphically in order to investigate the association between `mpg01` and the other features. Which of the other features seem most likely to be useful in predicting `mpg01`? Scatterplots and boxplots may be useful tools to answer this question. Describe your findings.

```{r, out.width = 1080, fig.align = "center"}
pairs(AutoN)

par(mfrow=c(1,4))
boxplot(weight ~ mpg01,
        data = AutoN,
        xlab = "mpg", ylab = "Weight")
boxplot(displacement ~ mpg01,
        data = AutoN,
        xlab = "mpg", ylab = "Displacement")
boxplot(acceleration ~ mpg01,
        data = AutoN,
        xlab = "mpg", ylab = "Acceleration")
boxplot(horsepower ~ mpg01,
        data = AutoN,
        xlab = "mpg", ylab = "Horsepower")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

(c) Split the data into a training set and a test set.

```{r}
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(AutoN$mpg01, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)

AutoN_training = AutoN[trainIndex, ]
AutoN_test = AutoN[-trainIndex, ]
```

(d) Perform LDA on the training data in order to predict `mpg01` using the variables that seemed most associated with `mpg01` in (b). What is the test error of the model obtained?

(e) Perform QDA on the training data in order to predict `mpg01` using the variables that seemed most associated with `mpg01` in (b). What is the test error of the model obtained?

(f) Perform logistic regression on the training data in order to predict `mpg01` using the variables that seemed most associated with `mpg01` in (b). What is the test error of the model obtained?

```{r}
AutoN_lrclassifier = glm(formula = mpg01 ~ weight + displacement + acceleration + horsepower,
                       family = binomial,
                       data = AutoN_training)
summary(AutoN_lrclassifier)

AutoN_pred = predict.glm(AutoN_lrclassifier, AutoN_test, type = 'response')
AutoN_test$pred = factor(ifelse(AutoN_pred > 0.5, 1, 0))

confusionMatrix(data = AutoN_test$pred, reference = AutoN_test$mpg01, mode = 'everything')
```

(g) Perform KNN on the training data, with several values of K, in order to predict `mpg01`. Use only the variables that seemed most associated with `mpg01` in (b). What test errors do you obtain? Which value of K seems to perform the best on this data set?


## Exercise 5.2

This problem involves writing functions.

(a) Write a function, `Power()`, that prints out the result of raising 2 to the 3rd power. In other words, your function should compute $2^3$ and print out the results.

    *Hint: Recall that `x^a` raises `x` to the power `a`. Use the `print()` function to output the result.*

(b) Create a new function, `Power2()`, that allows you to pass *any* two numbers, `x` and `a`, and prints out the value of `x^a`. You can do this by beginning your function with the line
```{r eval=FALSE}
Power2 <- function(x,a) {
```
You should be able to call your function by entering, for instance,
```{r eval=FALSE}
Power2(3,8)
```
on the command line. This should output the value of $3^8$, namely, 6,561.

(c) Using the `Power2()` function that you just wrote, compute $10^3$, $8^{17}$, and $131^3$.

(d) Now create a new function, `Power3()`, that actually returns the result `x^a` as an R object, rather than simply printing it to the screen. That is, if you store the value `x^a` in an object called `result` within your function, then you can simply `return()` this result, using the following line:

```{r eval=FALSE}
return(result)
```

The line above should be the last line in your function, before the `}` symbol.

(e) Now using the `Power3()` function, create a plot of $f(x) = x^2$. The $x$-axis should display a range of integers from 1 to 10, and the $y$-axis should display $x^2$. Label the axes appropriately, and use an appropriate title for the figure. Consider displaying either the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, or both on the log-scale. You can do this by using `log="x"`, `log="y"`, or `log="xy"` as arguments to the `plot()` function.

(f) Create a function, `PlotPower()`, that allows you to create a plot of `x` against `x^a` for a fixed `a` and for a range of values of `x`. For instance, if you call
```{r eval=FALSE}
PlotPower(1:10, 3)
```
then a plot should be created with an $x$-axis taking on values $1,2,\dots ,10$, and a $y$-axis taking on values $1^3,2^3,\dots ,10^3$.
